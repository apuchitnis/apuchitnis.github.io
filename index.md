## Hey folks, I'm Apu 👋

Engineer by day 🛠, stand-up comedian by night 🎙

I'm currently building a [startup](https://sidetrack.tech) at [Entrepreneur First](https://joinef.com). Stay tuned for details! 👀

I like hacking on side projects in my spare time:
* [🥗 Seasonal Foods](https://twitter.com/seasonalfoods3).
* [⏰ ProgressBar](http://progressbarwindows.com).
* [🎙 Open Mic Nights](https://apuchitnis.github.io/open-mic-nights).

Find my favourite programming memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apuchitnis), or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apuchitnis).

I formerly led teams at [Improbable](http://improbable.io/) and studied engineering at Cambridge.

I love to help where I can, and especially enjoy mentoring folks who are underrepresented or early-career. Get in [touch](https://calendly.com/apuchitnis) if you want to chat! 🗣
