## Hey folks, I'm Apu 👋

Engineer by day 🛠, stand-up comedian by night 🎙

I'm currently building a [startup](https://sidetrack.tech) at [Entrepreneur First](https://joinef.com). Stay tuned for details! 👀

I formerly led engineering teams at [Improbable](http://improbable.io/) and studied engineering at Cambridge.

I love to help people out where I can, and especially enjoy mentoring underrepresented folks. Get in [touch](https://calendly.com/apuchitnis) if you want to chat! 🗣
