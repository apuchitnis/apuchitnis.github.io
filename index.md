## Hey folks, I'm Apu ðŸ‘‹

Engineer by day ðŸ› , stand-up comedian by night ðŸŽ™

I'm currently building a [startup](https://sidetrack.tech) at [Entrepreneur First](https://joinef.com). Stay tuned for details! ðŸ‘€

Find my favourite programming memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apuchitnis), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apuchitnis)

I formerly led engineering teams at [Improbable](http://improbable.io/) and studied engineering at Cambridge.

I love to help people out where I can, and especially enjoy mentoring underrepresented folks. Get in [touch](https://calendly.com/apuchitnis) if you want to chat! ðŸ—£
