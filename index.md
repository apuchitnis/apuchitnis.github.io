## Hey folks, I'm Apu 👋

Engineer by day 🛠, stand-up comedian by night 🎙

I'm currently building a something new 😃. Stay tuned for details! 👀

I like hacking on side projects in my spare time:
* [⏰ ProgressBar](http://progressbarwindows.com) - A Windows Taskbar app that shows your day and year progress, also [🥇 Product Hunt's Golden Kitty Award Winner for Product of the Year 🍾](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/progressbar) and [🥇 #1 Product of the day on ProductHunt 🍾](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/progressbar).
* [🥗 Seasonal Foods](https://twitter.com/seasonalfoods3) - A Twitter bot that tells you which fruit and veg is currently in season.
* [🎙 London Standup Comedy Map](https://apuchitnis.github.io/open-mic-nights) - Find free and paid comedy nights to perform at in London. 

Find my favourite programming memes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apuchitnis), or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/apuchitnis).

I formerly led teams at [Improbable](http://improbable.io/) and studied engineering at Cambridge.

I love to help where I can, and especially enjoy mentoring folks who are underrepresented or early-career. Get in [touch](https://calendly.com/apuchitnis) if you want to chat! 🗣
